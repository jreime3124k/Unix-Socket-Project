Responsibilites will be designated next to each functional area below and in greater detail at the bottom of the document.
Version 2.0 introduces MultiThreading and supports multiple client connections at a time.  The SEND and WHO functions are also added.

Functions:

--MSGGET--Gareth
Reads a message from a file on the server and responds contents to the client.  It cycles through five pre-set messages sequentially and any added through the MSGSTORE command. It will start back at the beginning when it reaches the end.  There is a sub-function implemented in MSGGET command, ReadData, where it reads a string from the MoD.txt file and returns it to the MSGGET section were it is sent through the socket to the client.

--MSGSTORE--Gareth
Allows logged in users to add a message of the day to the MoD.txt file on the server.  Users will receive an error if they are not logged in.

--WHO--Gareth+Josh
List all active users, including the UserID and the users IP addresses.

--SEND--Gareth
Send a private message to an active user.  If the UserID is invalid or the receiver is not active, the server replies the client with an error message “420 either the user does not exist or is not logged in”; otherwise, the server forwards the message to the designated user.  In addition, the receiving client should process the message immediately.

--LOGOUT--Josh
Logs the user out of the system.

--QUIT--Gareth
Closes the client.  The server will wait for another connection.

--SHUTDOWN--Josh
Requires the user to be logged in as root.  The client will close and the server shutsdown all sockets and exits the program.

--LOGIN--Gareth+Josh
The user logs in with the format of LOGIN userid password.  Logged in users can add messages to the MSGSTORE and root may shutdown the server.

---------------------------------------
Instructions on how to run the program:
---------------------------------------
You will need two Linux/Unix terminal sessions.  Server can run without arguments, but client will need to be supplied with an IP address.  If it is the same Linux box for both you can use localhost or 127.0.0.1.  If the client is on a different box then ./client login.umd.umich.edu can be used.
The port number is a hard coded constant with 5556 as the value (SID).

--On server type ./server to start the listener
--On client type ./client IP ADDRESS, i.e. (./client 127.0.0.1)

The program will run with the commands listed in the assignment, or you may use the corresponding numbers in the menu.  When the user types MENU or ? a list of commands and corresponding numbers will be displayed.

CLIENT: ?
SERVER:
1) MSGGET: Get message
2) MSGSTORE: Add message(Must be logged in)
3) LOGOUT: Logout to server
4) QUIT: Close client application
5) SHUTDOWN: Shut down Server (Must be logged in)
>) LOGIN USER PASS : Login to server with username and password
CLIENT:

Build Instructions
------------------
Build in Unix by extracting the tar file to a directory and then typing "make".
If you wish to clean the directory, "make clean" will erase all object and program files.

Responsibilities
----------------
The project was split amounst us fairly as we had varying experience with C\C++.
We both refined each other's work with editing and validating code, as well as debugging.
